# MovementTracking
Python / ArcGIS scripts to manage movement data ... e.g. boulders along shoreline

Script Name (Purpose)
1) CreateEdgePointSHPFromExcel.pyc         (Main script used to convert Excel GPS data)
2) CreateMultiPointPolyFrom1PointSHP.pyc   (Convert point data from (1) to poly-line)
3) CreatePolyFrom2PointSHPs.pyc            (Convert point data from two  poly-lines created using (1) to block movement)
4) Arc_BearingCalc_Glamorgan_v2.pyc        (Add movement distance and bearing to output shapefile from (4))
5) Arc_BearingCalc_SingleSHP.py            (As above but for a single polyline shapefile e.g. layer edge)
6) ExportAttTableAndShapeAsCSV.py          (Export point shapefile attribute data including X,Y(,Z,M?) to .CSV file)
7) ExportAttTableAndShapeAsCSV_v2.py       (As above but can handle polylines â€¦ work-in-progress/experimental)
8) CheckSHPDetails.py                      (Quickly check info on spatial reference in use)
9) CreatePolygonFromPolylineSHP.py         (Create a block island polygon etc)

Excel files need to have specific layout/columns for above to work.
